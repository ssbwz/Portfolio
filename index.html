        <p>Hi there, I'm Saeed Ba Wazir, a software developer with a passion for making a difference in people's lives.
          From the earliest days of my studies in Fontys University of Applied Science, I have been captivated by the
          power of software to solve real-world problems and create meaningful change.</p>

        <p>As a software developer, I am constantly looking for new ways to innovate and create value for my clients and
          end-users. I pride myself on my strong communication skills, which allow me to collaborate effectively with
          clients and team members alike to deliver high-quality software solutions that meet their unique needs.</p>

        <p>One of the things I love most about software development is the opportunity to solve challenging problems and
          overcome obstacles. Whether it's debugging a particularly stubborn issue or devising a creative workaround for
          a tough technical challenge, I thrive on the excitement and sense of accomplishment that come with overcoming
          adversity.</p>
        <p>
          But perhaps what sets me apart most as a software developer is my love of learning and my self-driven nature.
          I
          am constantly seeking out new knowledge and skills, whether through online courses and reading technical
          articles, or attending industry conferences and events. I believe that the best software developers are those
          who are always hungry to learn and grow, and I am committed to staying at the forefront of my field.</p>
        <P>
          If you're looking for a software developer who is passionate, collaborative, and committed to delivering
          high-quality solutions, I would love to hear from you. Let's work together to build software that truly makes
          a
          difference in people's lives.</p>

            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in ICT from HBO-ICT, where I am gaining a comprehensive
              understanding of various ICT subjects. Through this program, I am learning about full stack development
              and software engineering, which is allowing me to become proficient in creating software applications from
              scratch.</p>
            <p>As a part of my Bachelor's program, I am working on (company) assignments and projects that are providing
              me with hands-on experience in the field. These projects are allowing me to apply the theoretical
              knowledge that I am acquiring in a practical setting. Additionally, I am working with real clients, which
              is helping me develop my communication and social skills, as well as teaching me how to deliver
              high-quality work that meets the needs of my clients.</p>
            <p>Overall, my education from HBO-ICT is providing me with a solid foundation in various areas of ICT and
              equipping me with the technical, social, and communication skills necessary to succeed in the field. As an
              ICT professional, I know that I will need to remain flexible and keep up with the latest developments, but
              my education is giving me the tools I need to be creative and become an expert in my specialisation. I am
              confident that I will be ready for the future of ICT, even for jobs that may not exist yet.</p>

                <p>As an AI engineer, I developed an application recommendations system that leverages AI to help users
                  find applications that fit their needs. This complex system uses AI algorithms to recommend
                  applications to users based on their preferences and behavior. For the backend, I used Flask, which is
                  a lightweight web framework that allowed for easy and flexible development. For the frontend, I used
                  React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I also used SQL for the database,
                  which allowed me to store and retrieve information quickly and efficiently. </p>
                <p>This project challenged me to think creatively and use the latest technologies in AI to build a
                  system that delivers value to users. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in AI
                  algorithms, Flask, React.js, and SQL, which will be useful in my future projects as an AI engineer.

                  resources such as calendars and email, resulting in a highly functional and secure solution.</p>
                <p>Through this project, I gained valuable experience in software development, agile methodologies, and
